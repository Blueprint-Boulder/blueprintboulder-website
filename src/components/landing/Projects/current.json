        "description": "Finding temporary childcare (i.e. babysitting, though in the foster care system it is called 'respite') requires meeting strict county guidelines, for good reason. However, this makes it difficult for foster parents to take time off, and often leads to burnout. Blueprint's respite-matching website will allow foster parents to find each other for respite when they need it, which will increase retention rates in the foster care system.",
